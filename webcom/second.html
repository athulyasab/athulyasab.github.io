    <p2>PROJECT 1 - 
           
    Tertiaries of Kerala</p2>
          
        <!--text taken from project notes-->
        <div class="text"> 
        The project was done as part of my studies on the topic Tertiaries of Kerala.The study mainly focused on the areas of Tertiaries of Kerala.Tertiary areas of Kerala was determined by with the help of Geologic Time Scale.Relevance of Geologic Time Scale was very noticeable in the project.
         Geologically, pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene formations is bulk in Kerala's terrain. The topography has of a hot , wet coastal plain gwith rising elevation due to high hills and mountains classification,  which are identified by of broad geomorphic  characteristics.
         Kerala can be divided into 3 Geographical regions: Highlands,Midlands and Low Lands . The High lands slope down from the Western Ghats have  height of 1000 m, with a number of peaks.
         To view the Geologic Time Scale <a href="https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/GSA/timescale/home.aspx">Geologic Time Scale</a>. As part of my project I was enthusiatic to visit different places in order to collect my data.I visted Varkala Cliff,Thirichendoor as part of my studies.THe badland topography in the district of Thirichendoor helped me to access the main core of the subject.

        <p2>PROJECT 2  -
        Mapping of Rubber Plantations in India</p2>
        
        <div class="text">
        Under the guidance of Dr.Pradeep Balan,Juniour Scientist in <a href="https://research.mgu.ac.in/research-centres/rubber-research-institute/">Rubber Research Institute of India</a> I have worked in a project which mainly focused on mapping the rubber plantations across India.
        The project helped me to understand the importance or application of remote sensing.The satellite images of Sentinel was selected from the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">USGS Earth Explorer</a>
        The project helped me to gain knowlwdge aboutdevelopment of GIS data base raster and vector based analysis,satellite data processing and preparation of maps.
        The project emphasized the relevance of ArcGis and Rolta Geomatica softwares.
