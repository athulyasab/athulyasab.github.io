    <p2>PROJECT 1 - 
           
    Tertiaries of Kerala</p2>
          
        <!--text taken from project notes-->
        <div class="text"> 
        The project was done as part of my studies on the topic Tertiaries of Kerala.The study mainly focused on the areas of Tertiaries of Kerala.Tertiary areas of Kerala was determined by with the help of Geologic Time Scale.Relevance of Geologic Time Scale was very noticeable in the project.
         Geologically, pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene formations is bulk in Kerala's terrain. The topography has of a hot , wet coastal plain gwith rising elevation due to high hills and mountains classification,  which are identified by of broad geomorphic  characteristics.
         Kerala can be divided into 3 Geographical regions: Highlands,Midlands and Low Lands . The High lands slope down from the Western Ghats have  height of 1000 m, with a number of peaks.
         To view the Geologic Time Scale <a href="https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/GSA/timescale/home.aspx">Geologic Time Scale</a>. As part of my project I was enthusiatic to visit different places in order to collect my data.I visted Varkala Cliff,Thirichendoor as part of my studies.THe badland topography in the district of Thirichendoor helped me to access the main core of the subject.In India, badland topography is found in the Chambal Basin. Badland topography means a region that is adversely affected by soil erosion, and the formation of deep gullies and ravines is common.

        <p2>PROJECT 2  -
        Mapping of Rubber Plantations in India</p2>
        
        <div class="text">
        Under the guidance of Dr.Pradeep Balan,Juniour Scientist in <a href="https://research.mgu.ac.in/research-centres/rubber-research-institute/">Rubber Research Institute of India</a> I have worked in a project which mainly focused on mapping the rubber plantations across India.
        The project helped me to understand the importance or application of remote sensing.The satellite images of Sentinel was selected from the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">USGS Earth Explorer</a>
        The project helped me to gain knowlwdge aboutdevelopment of GIS data base raster and vector based analysis,satellite data processing and preparation of maps.
        The project emphasized the relevance of ArcGis and Rolta Geomatica softwares.Since its inception in 1947, the Rubber Board had been developing expertise required for the orderly developments of the Indian rubber industry through R&D activities and constant interaction with the clients. The Rubber Industry, which consists of rubber plantation, rubber processing and rubber product manufacturing sectors has to be properly groomed to face challenges of the new millennium. The Rubber Board has the experience and expertise necessary for giving proper training to the rubber growers, rubber processors and rubber product manufacturers for practising modern scientific and cost effective techniques in the respective areas. In addition to the training to the clients, training is given to the employees of the Board for updating their technical and managerial skills.The Rubber Training Institute (RTI),  with its own small core faculty imparts specialised training in various aspects with a view to making available trained manpower required for the plantation and manufacturing sectors. Guest faculty from other departments of the Board as well as from external sources are invited from time to time for imparting specialised training. The training courses are conducted mainly at the Departmentâ€™s Training Institute.  Depending upon requirements, courses are also held at other venues.
